# Compiler-chain
A chain of compilers across various new and precreated languages, it should be fun.

# Wot u do:
Make a compiler in the most recent language, from a new language to the language the compiler is written in. In this way, a compiler chain will be formed


# Rules:
You may not make a compiler for a previously used language

Your language must have interactive io

Your language must be Turing complete.

Your language must have a way to generate random numbers/random bits (if you have random bits then you can get random numbers but with unknown time. in fact bf does this anyway)

Your language compiler must not be turing complete on the assumption that the numbers from the previous language are arbitrarily large, when they are not

Please don't bungle up stuff by submitting multiple compilers in the same language.

Give others a chance to get a language in there: if you have just submitted a language, wait until some time has passed, or someone else has made an interpreter


## Rules on premade langs:

I guess it would be cool to have some, but I think that a large amount of the languages should be newly made.
